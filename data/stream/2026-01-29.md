- 06:22 | [research] Do an exhaustive search to find all concierge, direct primary care, and integrative clinics in Asheville. I'm looking to put together a table: 1. Name 2. Phone Number 3. Address 4. Membership Fees (AI summary: how much does it cost and payment options) 5. What can you find about insurance (do they accept? use with some procedures? only provide superbill?) 6. Are they accepting new patients?
- 17:08 | Saturday 8am: bloodwork at Mercy urgent care West Asheville, then send to psychiatrist. Committed to 1hr/week PCP research calls (time-boxed). CBT worksheet due before next therapy Thursday 2/6. DC trip 2/9-2/12 for company super week - Audie daycare booked, need prep tasks (food containers, toys/blankets). Tax deadline 4/15. Performance reviews due 3/1.
- 17:09 | I have an appointment at 8am this Saturday at Mercy urgent care in West Asheville to get bloodwork done. Once that's done, I need to send it to my psychiatrist. After talking with my therapist, I've committed to dedicating an hour a week to make calls about PCP care and time boxing it so it isn't overwhelming. So I need reminders for that until that project completes when I do weekly planning or have a lull. I'm also supposed to complete this CBT worksheet about thoughts and feelings before my next therapy session next Thursday. Also I am now going to DC in February for my company's super week, flying in 2/9 evening and returning 2/12 afternoon. I'll need to make sure I'm prepared. I got Audie's daycare booked, but there are tasks I need to do, like putting her food into containers for each meal, making sure she has toys and blankets and things. Tax season is here and I need to be mindful to get it done by April 15. It's a busy time. I also have to do performance reviews and make time for that at work. They are due by March 1, but I have to make time to write them.
