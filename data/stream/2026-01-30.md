## Captures

- 12:33 | [research] I need you to look up integrative health clinics and doctors offices in Asheville. I want: 1. Name 2. Phone number 3. Address 4. Membership fees (AI summary: how much does it cost and what are options) 5. What can you find about insurance (do they accept? Do they use it for some procedures? Do they give a super bill?) 6. Are they accepting new patients?
- 21:44 | Frustrated with integrative clinic call - they won't deal with insurance, so Zepbound would be fully out of pocket (even though I qualify for coverage), sleep apnea testing would be out of pocket too. Need a PCP for diagnosis codes and referrals. Feel stuck. Labs scheduled for tomorrow but might need to reschedule due to snowstorm. Very tired.
