# Life Roles

This document defines the **roles I occupy in my life**. Roles are not identities I must perform perfectly, nor fixed labels I am trapped inside. They are **contexts of responsibility, care, and choice** that shape what matters and how I allocate attention and energy.

Roles function differently from values and goals:

* **Values** describe *how* I want to orient
* **Roles** describe *where* that orientation is expressed
* **Goals** describe *what* I am currently committing to within those roles

Roles can be stable or transient. Some persist across decades; others appear only for a season. All roles are revisitable.

## Core, Ongoing Roles

### 1. Self (Steward of Body, Mind, and Nervous System)

I am responsible for the care and stewardship of myself as an embodied being.

This role includes:

* Managing physical health, energy, and recovery
* Respecting sensory limits and nervous system needs
* Attending to mental health with seriousness and compassion
* Designing life structures that support regulation rather than depletion

This role is foundational. When it is neglected, all other roles degrade.

Some biographical information about me:
- Name: Colin Alford. I go by Coco with friends, Colin in my public/professional life.
- Birthday: 09/29/1987
- Hometown: Cookeville, TN

### 2. Caregiver (for Dependents and Those Who Rely on Me)

I hold responsibility for beings who depend on me, including my dog and any others in my care.

This role includes:

* Providing safety, consistency, and attunement
* Meeting practical needs reliably
* Making decisions that balance my needs with theirs

Caregiving is not self-erasure. It is a role that must coexist with self-stewardship.

---

### 3. Partner / Relational Being

I am a relational being who seeks connection rooted in mutual recognition, consent, and respect.

This role includes:

* Showing up honestly in relationships
* Maintaining boundaries without withdrawal or aggression
* Allowing intimacy at a pace that supports safety

This role may be expressed differently across friendships, romantic relationships, and chosen family, but the core orientation remains the same.

---

### 4. Friend and Community Member

I participate in communities and friendships where shared values, care, and creativity are possible.

This role includes:

* Being present and responsive within capacity
* Contributing without overextending
* Allowing relationships to change or end without forcing continuity

Depth and trust matter more than scale.

---

## Professional and Creative Roles

### 5. Craftsperson / Builder

I engage in building—systems, ideas, tools, or structures—that reduce friction and increase clarity.

This role includes:

* Applying skill thoughtfully rather than reactively
* Caring about quality and maintainability
* Balancing creativity with responsibility

This role values making things that *work* and endure.

---

### 6. Knowledge Worker / Thinker

I think, analyze, synthesize, and make sense of complex systems.

This role includes:

* Deep engagement with ideas
* Translating complexity into usable insight
* Respecting limits around cognitive overload

Thinking is a contribution, not a performance.

---

### 7. Creator / Writer

I create to explore, clarify, and share meaning.

This role includes:

* Writing as a tool for sense-making
* Allowing unfinished or imperfect work
* Creating without immediate external validation

Creation is a process, not a product pipeline.

---

## Temporal and Contextual Roles

### 8. Planner and Steward of Time

I plan across multiple horizons: daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, yearly.

This role includes:

* Making realistic commitments
* Revisiting plans without guilt
* Allowing rest and change

Planning exists to serve life, not dominate it.

---

### 9. Learner

I remain open to learning, unlearning, and updating my understanding.

This role includes:

* Curiosity without pressure
* Letting new information revise old beliefs
* Allowing growth without self-rejection

---

### 10. Integrator (of Past, Present, and Future Selves)

I integrate experiences across time rather than disowning past versions of myself.

This role includes:

* Making sense of change without erasure
* Honoring what previous selves protected
* Carrying lessons forward without shame

Integration creates continuity and self-trust.

---

## Notes on Role Conflict and Revision

* Roles may compete for time and energy; conflict does not imply failure.
* Not all roles are active at all times.
* Some roles may be intentionally minimized or rested during certain seasons.
* Roles can be renamed, merged, or retired as life changes.

The purpose of naming roles is **clarity**, not obligation.

---

## Closing Reflection

When deciding what matters or what to do next, a useful question is:

> “Which role am I serving right now, and is that the role I want to prioritize in this moment?”

This document should be revisited periodically and revised as roles shift over time.
