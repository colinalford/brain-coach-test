List your core values — what you refuse to sacrifice, what governs tradeoffs.
These determine what wins when priorities conflict.
Without explicit values, salience defaults to urgency, habit, or mood.

# Core Values

This document captures the values that orient my life and decision‑making. These are not ideals I try to perform, nor rules I must obey. They are **patterns I choose to live toward**—directions rather than destinations.

Values here serve a specific function in my Second Brain system:

* They act as **long‑term salience anchors** when short‑term signals are noisy
* They help resolve conflicts between competing priorities
* They provide language for reflection without judgment
* They are revisitable and revisable as I change

These values are informed by lived experience, not aspiration alone.

## 1. Clarity Over Confusion

I value seeing clearly—myself, others, situations, and tradeoffs.

Clarity means:

* Naming what is actually happening, not what I wish were happening
* Distinguishing fear, obligation, and desire
* Letting go of distorted self‑perception and inherited narratives

I accept that clarity can be uncomfortable. I prefer accurate pain to false comfort.

When this value is honored, I am grounded and decisive.
When it is violated, I become stuck, self‑doubting, or avoidant.

---

## 2. Alignment With Intrinsic Motivation

I value acting from what is internally meaningful rather than externally imposed.

This includes:

* Differentiating what I *want* from what I think I *should* want
* Questioning goals rooted in shame, fear, or comparison
* Trusting that sustained action requires internal consent

I allow myself to revise goals when they no longer feel intrinsic.
Persistence without consent is not virtue; it is erosion.

---

## 3. Reduction of Unnecessary Suffering

I value minimizing suffering—my own and others’—where it is within my influence.

This does not mean avoiding discomfort or challenge.
It means:

* Not adding pain through self‑punishment, neglect, or denial
* Designing systems and environments that support regulation and safety
* Acting with care when power, vulnerability, or dependence is involved

I recognize suffering as subjective and contextual. I respond with curiosity, not absolutism.

---

## 4. Agency Within Constraint

I value my capacity to choose *how* I respond, even when options are limited.

This includes:

* Accepting biological, social, and structural constraints without resignation
* Looking for leverage rather than total control
* Taking responsibility only for what is actually mine to carry

Agency is not limitless freedom; it is **meaningful choice within reality**.

---

## 5. Honesty Without Cruelty

I value truth spoken with care.

This applies both inwardly and outwardly:

* Naming real problems without exaggeration or minimization
* Setting boundaries without aggression
* Refusing to weaponize insight against myself or others

I believe honesty that destroys safety is not wisdom.

---

## 6. Embodied Presence

I value being grounded in my body and nervous system, not living purely in abstraction.

This includes:

* Treating somatic signals as real data
* Respecting energy limits, sensory needs, and recovery cycles
* Allowing rest, pleasure, and regulation to be legitimate priorities

I reject the idea that worth is proven through exhaustion.

---

## 7. Meaningful Connection

I value relationships rooted in mutual recognition, respect, and consent.

This means:

* Being known as I am, not as I perform
* Allowing difference without domination or erasure
* Choosing depth over breadth when capacity is limited

Connection is not constant availability. It is **felt safety over time**.

---

## 8. Growth Through Integration, Not Erasure

I value growth that integrates past selves rather than disowning them.

This includes:

* Honoring what earlier versions of me were trying to protect
* Learning from mistakes without rewriting history
* Letting change accumulate rather than restart from zero

I do not need to be purified to be whole.

---

## 9. Stewardship of Attention and Energy

I value protecting my attention as a finite and precious resource.

This means:

* Saying no to misaligned demands
* Designing systems that reduce cognitive load
* Prioritizing what matters over what is loud

Attention is the medium through which my life happens.

---

## 10. Openness to Revision

I value the right to change my mind.

This includes:

* Revisiting values, goals, and identities without shame
* Treating consistency as a tool, not a moral requirement
* Allowing new information to update old commitments

Stability matters—but rigidity is not the same thing.

---

## Closing Note

These values are **orienting principles**, not a checklist.

When choices are difficult or salience is unclear, the question is not:

> “Am I living up to these perfectly?”

But rather:

> “Which direction do these point me toward right now?”

This document should be revisited periodically and revised as lived understanding deepens.
