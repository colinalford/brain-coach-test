# Goals

This document captures my **specific, current goals**. These are concrete commitments I am choosing to make *now*, given my capacity, context, and priorities. They are not ideals, not identity claims, and not permanent obligations.

Goals translate **values and roles into action**:

* Values define *direction*
* Roles define *context*
* Goals define *what I am actively committing to in this period*

Goals are expected to change. Revising or releasing a goal is evidence of updated salience, not failure.

## How This Document Is Used

* Goals here should be **clear enough that progress is observable**.
* Each goal should be understandable without interpretation or motivational framing.
* Each goal implicitly answers:

  * Which role(s) does this serve?
  * Which value(s) does this express?

The Second Brain should treat this document as **authoritative but revisable state**.

## Active Goals (Now – Next 3 Months)

### 1. Fully operationalize my Second Brain system

**Definition of done:**

* Daily capture via Slack is habitual and low-friction
* Weekly and monthly review workflows are working end-to-end
* Identity (values, roles, goals, mission) is integrated into prioritization
* I am no longer manually organizing or re-entering information

**Serves roles:** Craftsperson / Builder, Planner, Self-steward

---

### 2. Establish a stable weekly review ritual

**Definition of done:**

* A weekly review occurs most weeks without dread or excessive duration
* Reviews surface priorities, stuck items, and role imbalance
* Review output directly informs the coming week’s plan

**Constraint:**

* Target duration: ≤ 60 minutes

**Serves roles:** Planner, Integrator

---

### 3. Reduce cognitive overload in day-to-day life

**Definition of done:**

* Tasks, worries, and ideas reliably get captured instead of rehearsed mentally
* Fewer open loops are held in working memory
* Decision fatigue is noticeably reduced

**Measurement:**

* Subjective reduction in overwhelm during planning and transitions

**Serves roles:** Self-steward, Planner

---

### 4. Maintain baseline nervous system stability

**Definition of done:**

* Daily routines support regulation rather than depletion
* Health-related tracking (e.g. blood pressure, medication context) is captured reliably
* Rest and recovery are treated as non-negotiable inputs

**Serves roles:** Self-steward

---

### 5. Make consistent, low-pressure progress on writing and thinking

**Definition of done:**

* Writing or structured thinking occurs multiple times per week

---

## Medium-Term Goals (3–12 Months)

### 6. Build a salience-first personal knowledge and life system I trust

**Definition of done:**

* The Second Brain consistently surfaces what matters
* I rely on the system rather than second-guessing it
* Reviews help clarify rather than overwhelm

**Serves roles:** Craftsperson / Builder, Integrator

---

### 7. Create more safety and ease in my lived experience

**Definition of done:**

* Fewer prolonged periods of dysregulation
* Clearer boundaries around energy and commitments
* Increased sense of agency in daily choices

**Serves roles:** Self-steward

### 8. Rebuild meaningful creative and relational engagement

**Definition of done:**

* Regular participation in creative or communal activities
* Relationships feel chosen, not obligatory
* Engagement fits my nervous system capacity

**Serves roles:** Creator, Friend, Relational Being

---

### 9. Publish foundational Constraint Dynamics Theory (CDT)

**Definition of done:**

* A clear “CDT Core” write-up exists as a coherent document (paper-length), with consistent terminology and a stable outline
* The repo is organized for public release (readme, structure, citations/refs where relevant)
* At least one public artifact is published (e.g., an arXiv preprint, a public website release, or an equivalent shareable publication)
* A short, accessible summary exists (1–3 pages) explaining CDT at a high level for non-specialists

**Serves roles:** Thinker, Creator / Writer, Craftsperson / Builder

---

## Longer-Horizon Directional Goals (1+ Years)

These are concrete *directions*, not rigid plans.

### 10. Live a life organized around clarity rather than fear

### 11. Build tools, writing, or frameworks that help others orient and reduce suffering

### 12. Maintain a life structure that supports agency, creativity, and connection

---

## Review and Release Rules

A goal should be reconsidered if:

* It is repeatedly deferred without external constraint
* It generates sustained push with no clear importance
* The role or value it served has changed
* New information alters feasibility or desirability

Releasing a goal intentionally is a valid and successful outcome.

---

## The Second Brain’s Responsibilities

The Second Brain should:

* Track which goals receive action vs. stagnation
* Cross-reference goals with values and roles during prioritization
* Surface gaps gently during reviews
* Treat avoidance and delay as **signal**, not failure
* Ask whether goals still have internal consent

The system may suggest adjustments or reflect patterns, but **final authority always remains with me**.

---

## Closing Note

Goals exist to focus effort, not to justify worth.

The guiding question is:

> “Given who I am and the life I’m living, are these the right commitments right now?”

This document should be revised whenever clarity changes.
