## Conversation

_Coach_: Let's do your monthly review. Here's your current context:

**Goals:**
- Daily capture via Slack is habitual and low-friction
- Weekly and monthly review workflows are working end-to-end
- Identity (values, roles, goals, mission) is integrated into prioritization
- I am no longer manually organizing or re-entering information
- A weekly review occurs most weeks without dread or excessive duration
- Reviews surface priorities, stuck items, and role imbalance
- Review output directly informs the coming weekâs plan
- Target duration: â¤ 60 minutes
- Tasks, worries, and ideas reliably get captured instead of rehearsed mentally
- Fewer open loops are held in working memory
- Decision fatigue is noticeably reduced
- Subjective reduction in overwhelm during planning and transitions
- Daily routines support regulation rather than depletion
- Health-related tracking (e.g. blood pressure, medication context) is captured reliably
- Rest and recovery are treated as non-negotiable inputs
- Writing or structured thinking occurs multiple times per week
- Output may be rough, unfinished, or private
- Momentum exists without self-punishment

**Open Loops:**
- [ ] Send bloodwork results to psychiatrist after Saturday appointment
- [ ] Complete CBT worksheet before next Thursday therapy session
- [ ] Prepare for DC trip Feb 9-12 (food containers for Audie, toys, blankets)
- [ ] Complete taxes by April 15
- [ ] Write performance reviews (due March 1)
- [ ] Weekly reminder: 1 hour of PCP research calls (time-boxed)
- [ ] Schedule dentist appointment for Saturday
- [ ] Groceries: eggs, bread, coffee
- [ ] Debug auth middleware issue in API refactor
- [ ] what-matters test marker [test:wm_1769981309094]

Reflect on the past month — what happened, what got done, what didn't, what's on your mind. Write freely.

**User**: This month was overwhelming. Work consumed everything — long hours on the API migration. Health took a backseat. I did start seeing a new therapist which feels like progress. Engineering lead role dominated. Dad role suffered — missed two soccer games. Exercise goal totally failed. The therapy goal is new but going well. Keep: finish API migration, therapy sessions. Drop: the blog rewrite.

_Coach_: ## What I Heard

The weight of work consuming everything while other vital parts of life slipped away. The guilt around missing your kids' games. The exhaustion of long hours. But also the hope in starting therapy and recognizing what needs to shift.

## Cognitive Sort

**What's Working:**
- New therapist relationship established and progressing
- API migration advancing (though at high cost)
- Self-awareness about role imbalances

**What's Struggling:**
- Health routines abandoned
- Dad role compromised (missed soccer games)
- Exercise completely derailed
- Work-life boundaries collapsed

**What's Emerging:**
- Therapy as a new support system
- Clear recognition of unsustainable patterns

**Needs Immediate Attention:**
- Role rebalancing between engineering lead and dad
- Health as non-negotiable input (your own goal)
- Sustainable work pace post-migration

## Role & Goal Mapping

**Engineering Lead:** Advanced but at unsustainable cost
**Dad:** Significant slip - missed key moments
**Health Goals:** Major regression across exercise and self-care
**Systems Goals:** Therapy integration working; capture/review systems unclear during crunch

## Extracted Commitments & Focus

**Keep:**
- Finish API migration
- Continue therapy sessions

**Drop:**
- Blog rewrite

**Implicit Priorities:**
- Restore dad role presence
- Rebuild health routines post-migration
- Establish sustainable work boundaries

Is there anything else about this month - wins, struggles, or things on your mind - before I help you build next month's plan?

**User**: February focus: finish API migration by mid-month, then protect personal time. Commit to gym 2x/week. Keep therapy weekly. Start tax prep before March. Performance reviews due March 1 — need to start drafts.
