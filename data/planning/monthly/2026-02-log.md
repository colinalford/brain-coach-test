## Conversation

_Coach_: Let's do your monthly review. Here's your current context:

**Goals:**
- Daily capture via Slack is habitual and low-friction
- Weekly and monthly review workflows are working end-to-end
- Identity (values, roles, goals, mission) is integrated into prioritization
- I am no longer manually organizing or re-entering information
- A weekly review occurs most weeks without dread or excessive duration
- Reviews surface priorities, stuck items, and role imbalance
- Review output directly informs the coming weekâs plan
- Target duration: â¤ 60 minutes
- Tasks, worries, and ideas reliably get captured instead of rehearsed mentally
- Fewer open loops are held in working memory
- Decision fatigue is noticeably reduced
- Subjective reduction in overwhelm during planning and transitions
- Daily routines support regulation rather than depletion
- Health-related tracking (e.g. blood pressure, medication context) is captured reliably
- Rest and recovery are treated as non-negotiable inputs
- Writing or structured thinking occurs multiple times per week
- Output may be rough, unfinished, or private
- Momentum exists without self-punishment

**Open Loops:**
- [ ] Send bloodwork results to psychiatrist after Saturday appointment
- [ ] Complete CBT worksheet before next Thursday therapy session
- [ ] Prepare for DC trip Feb 9-12 (food containers for Audie, toys, blankets)
- [ ] Complete taxes by April 15
- [ ] Write performance reviews (due March 1)
- [ ] Weekly reminder: 1 hour of PCP research calls (time-boxed)
- [ ] Schedule dentist appointment for Saturday
- [ ] Groceries: eggs, bread, coffee
- [ ] Debug auth middleware issue in API refactor
- [ ] what-matters test marker [test:wm_1769981309094]

Reflect on the past month — what happened, what got done, what didn't, what's on your mind. Write freely.

**User**: This month was overwhelming. Work consumed everything — long hours on the API migration. Health took a backseat. I did start seeing a new therapist which feels like progress. Engineering lead role dominated. Dad role suffered — missed two soccer games. Exercise goal totally failed. The therapy goal is new but going well. Keep: finish API migration, therapy sessions. Drop: the blog rewrite.

_Coach_: ## ACKNOWLEDGMENT
I hear the overwhelm — work completely took over, and that came at real costs. Missing those soccer games hits differently when you're already stretched thin. The therapy progress is genuinely meaningful progress though, especially starting something new during chaos.

## COGNITIVE SORT

**What's Working:**
- New therapy relationship established and going well
- API migration has clear momentum (you want to finish it)
- Recognition of what needs to drop (blog rewrite)

**What's Struggling:**
- Health completely sidelined
- Dad role significantly impacted (missed 2 soccer games)
- Exercise goal completely failed
- Work-life boundaries nonexistent

**What's Emerging:**
- Therapy as new support system
- Clear prioritization instincts (keep/drop decisions)

**Needs Immediate Attention:**
- Engineering lead role balance
- Dad role recovery
- Health baseline restoration

## ROLE AND GOAL MAPPING

**Engineering Lead:** Advancing (API migration progress) but consuming everything else
**Dad:** Slipping badly (missed games, role "suffered")
**Health/Self-Care:** Failed (exercise goal, health took backseat)
**Personal Growth:** Advancing (therapy progress)

**Goals Impact:**
- Daily routines supporting regulation: FAILED
- Rest/recovery non-negotiable: FAILED  
- Reduced overwhelm: OPPOSITE occurred
- Writing/structured thinking: Unclear, but likely suffered

## EXTRACTED COMMITMENTS & FOCUS
- **Keep:** Finish API migration, continue therapy sessions
- **Drop:** Blog rewrite
- **Implicit priorities:** Dad role recovery, health restoration
- **Urgent:** Boundary setting around engineering lead demands

Is there anything else about this month — any other wins, struggles, or things weighing on you — before I help you plan forward?

**User**: February focus: finish API migration by mid-month, then protect personal time. Commit to gym 2x/week. Keep therapy weekly. Start tax prep before March. Performance reviews due March 1 — need to start drafts.

_Coach_: ## Theme
Finish strong, then protect and restore

## Focus Areas
- Engineering: Complete API migration by mid-month
- Health: Establish consistent gym routine
- Personal growth: Maintain therapy momentum
- Professional: Get ahead on performance reviews
- Financial: Tax preparation startup

## Commitments
- [ ] Complete API migration by February 15th
- [ ] Gym 2x per week starting after migration completion
- [ ] Weekly therapy sessions (continue current cadence)
- [ ] Start performance review drafts by February 20th
- [ ] Begin tax preparation by February 25th
- [ ] Protect personal time boundaries after mid-month migration completion

## Open Loops (carrying forward)
- Send bloodwork results to psychiatrist after Saturday appointment
- Complete CBT worksheet before next Thursday therapy session
- Prepare for DC trip Feb 9-12 (food containers for Audie, toys, blankets)
- Schedule dentist appointment for Saturday
- Groceries: eggs, bread, coffee
- Weekly reminder: 1 hour of PCP research calls (time-boxed)
