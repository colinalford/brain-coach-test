## Conversation

_Coach_: Let's do your monthly review. Here's your current context:

**Goals:**
- Daily capture via Slack is habitual and low-friction
- Weekly and monthly review workflows are working end-to-end
- Identity (values, roles, goals, mission) is integrated into prioritization
- I am no longer manually organizing or re-entering information
- A weekly review occurs most weeks without dread or excessive duration
- Reviews surface priorities, stuck items, and role imbalance
- Review output directly informs the coming weekâs plan
- Target duration: â¤ 60 minutes
- Tasks, worries, and ideas reliably get captured instead of rehearsed mentally
- Fewer open loops are held in working memory
- Decision fatigue is noticeably reduced
- Subjective reduction in overwhelm during planning and transitions
- Daily routines support regulation rather than depletion
- Health-related tracking (e.g. blood pressure, medication context) is captured reliably
- Rest and recovery are treated as non-negotiable inputs
- Writing or structured thinking occurs multiple times per week
- Output may be rough, unfinished, or private
- Momentum exists without self-punishment

**Open Loops:**
- [ ] Send bloodwork results to psychiatrist after Saturday appointment
- [ ] Complete CBT worksheet before next Thursday therapy session
- [ ] Prepare for DC trip Feb 9-12 (food containers for Audie, toys, blankets)
- [ ] Complete taxes by April 15
- [ ] Write performance reviews (due March 1)
- [ ] Weekly reminder: 1 hour of PCP research calls (time-boxed)
- [ ] Schedule dentist appointment for Saturday
- [ ] Groceries: eggs, bread, coffee
- [ ] Debug auth middleware issue in API refactor

Reflect on the past month — what happened, what got done, what didn't, what's on your mind. Write freely.

**User**: This month was overwhelming. Work consumed everything — long hours on the API migration. Health took a backseat. I did start seeing a new therapist which feels like progress. Engineering lead role dominated. Dad role suffered — missed two soccer games. Exercise goal totally failed. The therapy goal is new but going well. Keep: finish API migration, therapy sessions. Drop: the blog rewrite.

_Coach_: ## ACKNOWLEDGMENT
I hear the weight of this month — work consuming everything feels exhausting, and missing those soccer games as a dad hits hard. The overwhelm is real when one role dominates at the expense of others. At the same time, starting therapy is significant progress worth recognizing.

## COGNITIVE SORT

**What's Working:**
• Therapy sessions - new but going well
• API migration progress (though consuming)
• Clear decision-making (keep/drop items)

**What's Struggling:**
• Role balance - engineering lead dominated everything
• Health and exercise - completely backburnered
• Dad role - missed key moments (2 soccer games)
• Energy management - overwhelm from work hours

**What's Emerging:**
• Therapy as a new support system
• Recognition of unsustainable work pace
• Clearer prioritization instincts

**Needs Immediate Attention:**
• Role rebalancing before more dad moments are lost
• Health baseline restoration
• Work boundary setting

## MAPPING TO ROLES & GOALS

**Engineering Lead Role:** Advanced but at high cost
**Dad Role:** Significant slippage - missed concrete moments
**Health Goals:** Failed completely (exercise, general health)
**System Goals:** Mixed - good decision-making, but overwhelm suggests boundaries failed

## EXTRACTED COMMITMENTS & FOCUS
• **Keep:** API migration completion, therapy sessions
• **Drop:** Blog rewrite
• **Implicit Priority:** Role rebalancing
• **Urgent:** Preventing further dad role erosion

Is there anything else about this month before I generate your plan for moving forward?

**User**: February focus: finish API migration by mid-month, then protect personal time. Commit to gym 2x/week. Keep therapy weekly. Start tax prep before March. Performance reviews due March 1 — need to start drafts.

_Coach_: **Monthly Plan Committed!**
