## Conversation

_Coach_: Let's do your monthly review. Here's your current context:

**Goals:**
- Daily capture via Slack is habitual and low-friction
- Weekly and monthly review workflows are working end-to-end
- Identity (values, roles, goals, mission) is integrated into prioritization
- I am no longer manually organizing or re-entering information
- A weekly review occurs most weeks without dread or excessive duration
- Reviews surface priorities, stuck items, and role imbalance
- Review output directly informs the coming weekâs plan
- Target duration: â¤ 60 minutes
- Tasks, worries, and ideas reliably get captured instead of rehearsed mentally
- Fewer open loops are held in working memory
- Decision fatigue is noticeably reduced
- Subjective reduction in overwhelm during planning and transitions
- Daily routines support regulation rather than depletion
- Health-related tracking (e.g. blood pressure, medication context) is captured reliably
- Rest and recovery are treated as non-negotiable inputs
- Writing or structured thinking occurs multiple times per week
- Output may be rough, unfinished, or private
- Momentum exists without self-punishment

**Open Loops:**
- [ ] Send bloodwork results to psychiatrist after Saturday appointment
- [ ] Complete CBT worksheet before next Thursday therapy session
- [ ] Prepare for DC trip Feb 9-12 (food containers for Audie, toys, blankets)
- [ ] Complete taxes by April 15
- [ ] Write performance reviews (due March 1)
- [ ] Weekly reminder: 1 hour of PCP research calls (time-boxed)

Reflect on the past month — what happened, what got done, what didn't, what's on your mind. Write freely.

**User**: Its been a hard month. I've mostly been just working, like long days and every weekend. This is the first weekend I haven't worked in three weekends. I've been working long hours, too. Its been stressful. I started better medication, clondidine more regularly, and that helped.

I was supposed to start pottery classes. I missed the first two because I worked too late and I was stressed and the clonidine was impacting my energy levels. Then we had two major winter storms and I've barely left the house. Its been rough, bleak. I feel very lonely. I'm not talking to my friends as much. I'm happy that it is Imbolc tomorrow. We've turned the corner. We're in the deepest of winter in one sense, hence the extreme weather. But on the other hand, its almost over. I've been noticing the light returning already, and it brings some hope.

I've been working on this system. its honestly been a time suck. Part of it is a good and useful learning processs. I've learned new tech. But I've been pretty lazy about letting the LLM work, and I'm not getting outputs I want. I've rearchitected the system a few times. Im not sure it works right now. I've been trying to get the LLM to test the damn software -- write BDD style e2e tests. It regularly just doesn't. I'm using claude code, supposed to be the best. I've got to figure out other workflows, because it will just skip tests, say they are too hard, make up excuses. On the other hand, I'm getting it to consistently execute very long tasks, like over an hour. So that feels good. The learning there is to write a full spec and a process, come up with a plan, then have it execute. I really just want the assistant and second brain to work, so it sucks I'm spending so much time. But I legit am learning a lot. the cloudflare worker plus durable object thing is pretty awesome.

I'm really struggling with the medical stuff overall. Finding a PCP is so so hard. I tried to pay either a concierge or DPC or integrative clinic. The concierge that also work iwht insurance have waitlists and only have space when someone dies or moves. The integrative and DPC clinics basically will cost me a lot more money because the whole thing with your PCP being the first stop for referrals that then justifies specialists for insurance -- they don't do it. So every time I go to a specialist, I'd have to pay for the initial visit, then insurance would pay. So I think I need to just try to find a PCP in the normal system. Its so frustrating. I've spent probably between 1-2 working days on this since early January. Its so hard. And I have medical needs going unmet: regular blood work, I desperately need to get my thyroid checked given past issues, I need a colonoscopy due to family history of colon cancer, I basically know I have sleep apnea and need a sleep study. And I should qualify for insurnace to pay for my zepbound, so I want them to pay it so I don't ahve to pay so much out of pocket.

I've also been taking more clonidine than presrcibed. I need it. I need to talk to my doctor about it. 0.3mg/day just doesn't cut it. I should probably be on like 0.6. And ideally the patch. But also I don't think its the only medication I need to be on. I should be on maybe an SSRI or mood stabilizer or something else. Its not cutting it. Sometimes I'm getting to the point where I can relax, like i actually feel the tension in my body go away, but its rare.

Beyond that, I'm just feeling I need change in my life. Work is killing me. I'm not sure how that changes. But there's no incentive for me to do anything but work right now. I'm afraid because of AI and the job landscape. Not sure what the future holds. And I don't have alternatie outlets or have any idea how I'll find them. No friends, no hobbies, i never leave the house except to take my dog to daycare. I don't even go out to eat anymore. The anhedonia is pretty through the roof.

I need to work on my routines. I'm just completely out of them. Walks have gone out the window -- but to be fair, its been high of 20, we've had ice storms and got like 8 inches of snow last night. Its been brutal. It feels like -4 today. And I can't take my dog to walk through snow when its this cold without hurting her paws. So I just have to have some grace.

But I think that really high exertion strength training might do what the clonidine does: huge norephinphrine spike and dump followed by a clear signal the threat is over and to downregulate. When I did that kind of high intensity workout in the past, it help my mental health. A couple times a week, then lower intensity other times. I really should start doing it on Saturdays so I have maximum time to recover. And there's the reality I am untrained right now, so I have to figure out how to do that.

I also want to pivot how I work with Dana to be more focused on daily routines: eating regularly, working out, getting my life in order day-to-day. Focusing on the PCP every week isn't helping, I just need to let that be a side project.

Thinking about reviewing this month, its been overworking, anhedonia, frustration, inability to get momentum or traction, collapse of routines, but also a few seeds sewn: restarting therapy with a new style (CBT with Dana), finding a psychiatrist who works for the VA and I feel he actually understands my PTSD better than most and I've started taking meds that help more. I feel like it matches the season I'm in: depths of winter despair, but knowing by Imbolc, the earth is pregnant and waiting to give birth.

_Coach_: Moving on. What priorities do you want to focus on for the next period?

**User**: I just gave you a huge dump what do you mean? you're supposed to be helping

_Coach_: You're absolutely right - I'm sorry. You just poured your heart out about a really difficult month, and I jumped straight to "what's next" without acknowledging what you shared or helping you process it. That was tone-deaf of me.

Let me actually respond to what you told me:

**What I'm hearing:** You've been grinding through an incredibly hard month - working every weekend, long hours, feeling isolated and burned out. The winter storms trapped you inside, you missed pottery classes that could have been a lifeline, and you're dealing with serious medical needs that aren't being met because finding a PCP is an impossible maze. You're taking more clonidine than prescribed just to function, and the anhedonia is brutal.

**But also:** You found a psychiatrist who actually gets your PTSD. You're trying CBT with Dana. The medication is helping more than before. And despite everything, you recognize we're at Imbolc - the turning point where light returns, even in the depths of winter.

**The system work** sounds like it's been both a learning opportunity and a frustrating time sink when you need things that just work.

You mentioned wanting to shift focus with Dana to daily routines rather than the PCP hunt, and thinking about high-intensity strength training as a way to recreate that norepinephrine cycle the clonidine provides.

Before we talk about next steps - how does it feel to have all of that witnessed? And what feels most urgent or important to address first?

**User**: No, like I just gave you a dump and you are supposed to be creating a plan

_Coach_: You're right - let me synthesize what you shared into a plan for the next month.

**February Plan:**

**Core Focus Areas:**
1. **Daily routines over PCP hunt** - Shift Dana sessions to focus on eating regularly, working out, basic life structure
2. **High-intensity strength training** - Start Saturdays for maximum recovery time, rebuild from untrained state
3. **Medical maintenance** - Talk to psychiatrist about clonidine dosage (0.6mg target, maybe patch), discuss additional meds
4. **System completion** - Stop rearchitecting, focus on getting consistent LLM outputs with full specs and processes

**Immediate Actions:**
- Send bloodwork results to psychiatrist after Saturday appointment + discuss clonidine increase
- Complete CBT worksheet before Thursday therapy session  
- Prep for DC trip Feb 9-12
- Stop spending working days on PCP research - time-box to 1 hour/week or pause entirely

**Boundaries:**
- No working weekends (protect what you just reclaimed)
- Give you
