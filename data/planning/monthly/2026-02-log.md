## Conversation

_Coach_: Let's do your monthly review. Here's your current context:

**Goals:**
- Daily capture via Slack is habitual and low-friction
- Weekly and monthly review workflows are working end-to-end
- Identity (values, roles, goals, mission) is integrated into prioritization
- I am no longer manually organizing or re-entering information
- A weekly review occurs most weeks without dread or excessive duration
- Reviews surface priorities, stuck items, and role imbalance
- Review output directly informs the coming weekâs plan
- Target duration: â¤ 60 minutes
- Tasks, worries, and ideas reliably get captured instead of rehearsed mentally
- Fewer open loops are held in working memory
- Decision fatigue is noticeably reduced
- Subjective reduction in overwhelm during planning and transitions
- Daily routines support regulation rather than depletion
- Health-related tracking (e.g. blood pressure, medication context) is captured reliably
- Rest and recovery are treated as non-negotiable inputs
- Writing or structured thinking occurs multiple times per week
- Output may be rough, unfinished, or private
- Momentum exists without self-punishment

**Open Loops:**
- [ ] Send bloodwork results to psychiatrist after Saturday appointment
- [ ] Complete CBT worksheet before next Thursday therapy session
- [ ] Prepare for DC trip Feb 9-12 (food containers for Audie, toys, blankets)
- [ ] Complete taxes by April 15
- [ ] Write performance reviews (due March 1)
- [ ] Weekly reminder: 1 hour of PCP research calls (time-boxed)
- [ ] Schedule dentist appointment for Saturday
- [ ] Groceries: eggs, bread, coffee
- [ ] Debug auth middleware issue in API refactor
- [ ] what-matters test marker [test:wm_1769981309094]

Reflect on the past month — what happened, what got done, what didn't, what's on your mind. Write freely.

**User**: This month was overwhelming. Work consumed everything — long hours on the API migration. Health took a backseat. I did start seeing a new therapist which feels like progress. Engineering lead role dominated. Dad role suffered — missed two soccer games. Exercise goal totally failed. The therapy goal is new but going well. Keep: finish API migration, therapy sessions. Drop: the blog rewrite.

_Coach_: **ACKNOWLEDGMENT**
I hear the weight of this month — work consuming everything while other important parts of your life got squeezed out. Missing those soccer games as a dad hits different than missing other things. The overwhelm is real, and it sounds like you're carrying some heaviness about the imbalance.

**COGNITIVE SORT**

*What's Working:*
- New therapist relationship established and going well
- API migration progressing (though at high personal cost)
- Clear decision-making: identified what to keep vs drop

*What's Struggling:*
- Health completely sidelined
- Exercise goal failed entirely
- Dad role suffering — concrete impact (missed games)
- Work-life boundaries non-existent

*What's Emerging:*
- Therapy as new positive routine
- Recognition of role imbalance
- Clearer prioritization instincts

*Needs Attention:*
- Engineering lead role boundaries
- Dad role repair/recommitment
- Health as non-negotiable input (your own goal)

**ROLE/GOAL MAPPING**

*Engineering Lead:* Advanced but at unsustainable cost
*Dad:* Clear regression — missed key moments
*Health/Self-care:* Major slip from stated goals
*Personal Systems:* Some progress (therapy), some abandonment (exercise, health tracking)

**EXTRACTED COMMITMENTS**
- Keep: Finish API migration
- Keep: Continue therapy sessions
- Drop: Blog rewrite
- Implicit: Need to rebalance dad role
- Implicit: Health needs to return as priority

**URGENT ITEMS FROM YOUR LOOPS**
- CBT worksheet (therapy Thursday)
- Bloodwork to psychiatrist (Saturday appointment)
- Performance reviews (March 1 deadline)

Anything else weighing on you before I help you build a plan for the coming month?

**User**: February focus: finish API migration by mid-month, then protect personal time. Commit to gym 2x/week. Keep therapy weekly. Start tax prep before March. Performance reviews due March 1 — need to start drafts.

_Coach_: ## Theme
Finish strong, then rebalance

## Focus Areas
- Engineering Lead: Complete API migration by mid-February
- Health/Self-care: Establish gym routine and maintain therapy
