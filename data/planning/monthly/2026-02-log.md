## Conversation

_Coach_: Let's do your monthly review. Here's your current context:

**Goals:**
- Daily capture via Slack is habitual and low-friction
- Weekly and monthly review workflows are working end-to-end
- Identity (values, roles, goals, mission) is integrated into prioritization
- I am no longer manually organizing or re-entering information
- A weekly review occurs most weeks without dread or excessive duration
- Reviews surface priorities, stuck items, and role imbalance
- Review output directly informs the coming weekâs plan
- Target duration: â¤ 60 minutes
- Tasks, worries, and ideas reliably get captured instead of rehearsed mentally
- Fewer open loops are held in working memory
- Decision fatigue is noticeably reduced
- Subjective reduction in overwhelm during planning and transitions
- Daily routines support regulation rather than depletion
- Health-related tracking (e.g. blood pressure, medication context) is captured reliably
- Rest and recovery are treated as non-negotiable inputs
- Writing or structured thinking occurs multiple times per week
- Output may be rough, unfinished, or private
- Momentum exists without self-punishment

**Open Loops:**
- [ ] Send bloodwork results to psychiatrist after Saturday appointment
- [ ] Complete CBT worksheet before next Thursday therapy session
- [ ] Prepare for DC trip Feb 9-12 (food containers for Audie, toys, blankets)
- [ ] Complete taxes by April 15
- [ ] Write performance reviews (due March 1)
- [ ] Weekly reminder: 1 hour of PCP research calls (time-boxed)

Reflect on the past month — what happened, what got done, what didn't, what's on your mind. Write freely.

**User**: This month was overwhelming. Work consumed everything — long hours on the API migration. Health took a backseat. I did start seeing a new therapist which feels like progress. Engineering lead role dominated. Dad role suffered — missed two soccer games. Exercise goal totally failed. The therapy goal is new but going well. Keep: finish API migration, therapy sessions. Drop: the blog rewrite.

_Coach_: ## ACKNOWLEDGMENT
I hear the weight of this month — work completely taking over, health sliding, missing those soccer games. That's genuinely hard, especially when you're trying to balance an engineering leadership role with being present as a dad. The overwhelm is real and valid.

## COGNITIVE SORT

**What's Working:**
- New therapist relationship established and going well
- API migration has momentum (you want to finish it)
- Weekly/monthly review system functioning (you're here doing this)

**What's Struggling:**
- Health goals completely derailed
- Exercise goal "totally failed" 
- Dad role suffering (missed soccer games)
- Work-life boundaries obliterated

**What's Emerging:**
- Therapy as a new, positive practice
- Clear recognition of what to keep vs. drop

**What Needs Attention:**
- Role balance (Engineering Lead vs. Dad)
- Health as "non-negotiable input" per your goals
- Sustainable work boundaries during major projects

## MAPPING TO ROLES & GOALS

**Advanced:**
- Weekly/monthly review workflows ✓
- New therapeutic support system ✓

**Slipped:**
- "Rest and recovery are treated as non-negotiable inputs" - health took backseat
- Dad role engagement
- "Daily routines support regulation rather than depletion" - long work hours

**Urgent:**
- Finishing API migration (you identified as "keep")
- Re-establishing dad role presence
- Health baseline restoration

## EXTRACTED COMMITMENTS & FOCUS
- **Keep:** API migration completion, therapy sessions
- **Drop:** Blog rewrite
- **Implicit priority:** Role rebalancing after API migration
- **Focus areas:** Sustainable work boundaries, dad role recovery, health baseline

Is there anything else about this month or your current state that I should factor in before we create your plan for the coming month?

**User**: February focus: finish API migration by mid-month, then protect personal time. Commit to gym 2x/week. Keep therapy weekly. Start tax prep before March. Performance reviews due March 1 — need to start drafts.

_Coach_: **Monthly Plan Committed!**
