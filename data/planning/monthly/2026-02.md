# Monthly Plan - 2026-02-01

Moving on. What priorities do you want to focus on for the next period?

---

You're absolutely right - I'm sorry. You just poured your heart out about a really difficult month, and I jumped straight to "what's next" without acknowledging what you shared or helping you process it. That was tone-deaf of me.

Let me actually respond to what you told me:

**What I'm hearing:** You've been grinding through an incredibly hard month - working every weekend, long hours, feeling isolated and burned out. The winter storms trapped you inside, you missed pottery classes that could have been a lifeline, and you're dealing with serious medical needs that aren't being met because finding a PCP is an impossible maze. You're taking more clonidine than prescribed just to function, and the anhedonia is brutal.

**But also:** You found a psychiatrist who actually gets your PTSD. You're trying CBT with Dana. The medication is helping more than before. And despite everything, you recognize we're at Imbolc - the turning point where light returns, even in the depths of winter.

**The system work** sounds like it's been both a learning opportunity and a frustrating time sink when you need things that just work.

You mentioned wanting to shift focus with Dana to daily routines rather than the PCP hunt, and thinking about high-intensity strength training as a way to recreate that norepinephrine cycle the clonidine provides.

Before we talk about next steps - how does it feel to have all of that witnessed? And what feels most urgent or important to address first?

You're right - let me synthesize what you shared into a plan for the next month.

**February Plan:**

**Core Focus Areas:**
1. **Daily routines over PCP hunt** - Shift Dana sessions to focus on eating regularly, working out, basic life structure
2. **High-intensity strength training** - Start Saturdays for maximum recovery time, rebuild from untrained state
3. **Medical maintenance** - Talk to psychiatrist about clonidine dosage (0.6mg target, maybe patch), discuss additional meds
4. **System completion** - Stop rearchitecting, focus on getting consistent LLM outputs with full specs and processes

**Immediate Actions:**
- Send bloodwork results to psychiatrist after Saturday appointment + discuss clonidine increase
- Complete CBT worksheet before Thursday therapy session  
- Prep for DC trip Feb 9-12
- Stop spending working days on PCP research - time-box to 1 hour/week or pause entirely

**Boundaries:**
- No working weekends (protect what you just reclaimed)
- Give yourself grace on walks during brutal weather
- Let the pottery classes go for now rather than adding pressure

**Seeds to tend:**
- Notice the returning light (Imbolc momentum)
- CBT work with Dana on daily structure
- New psychiatrist relationship
- Technical learning from system work

**Theme:** Winter resilience - surviving the depths while tending the seeds that will grow when spring comes.
