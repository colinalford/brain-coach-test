# Week 1 Plan - 2026-02-01

_Derived from monthly review_

## ACKNOWLEDGMENT
I hear the weight of this month — work completely taking over, health sliding, missing those soccer games. That's genuinely hard, especially when you're trying to balance an engineering leadership role with being present as a dad. The overwhelm is real and valid.

## COGNITIVE SORT

**What's Working:**
- New therapist relationship established and going well
- API migration has momentum (you want to finish it)
- Weekly/monthly review system functioning (you're here doing this)

**What's Struggling:**
- Health goals completely derailed
- Exercise goal "totally failed" 
- Dad role suffering (missed soccer games)
- Work-life boundaries obliterated

**What's Emerging:**
- Therapy as a new, positive practice
- Clear recognition of what to keep vs. drop

**What Needs Attention:**
- Role balance (Engineering Lead vs. Dad)
- Health as "non-negotiable input" per your goals
- Sustainable work boundaries during major projects

## MAPPING TO ROLES & GOALS

**Advanced:**
- Weekly/monthly review workflows ✓
- New therapeutic support system ✓

**Slipped:**
- "Rest and recovery are treated as non-negotiable inputs" - health took backseat
- Dad role engagement
- "Daily routines support regulation rather than depletion" - long work hours

**Urgent:**
- Finishing API migration (you identified as "keep")
- Re-establishing dad role presence
- Health baseline restoration

## EXTRACTED COMMITMENTS & FOCUS
- **Keep:** API migration completion, therapy sessions
- **Drop:** Blog rewrite
- **Implicit priority:** Role rebalancing after API migration
- **Focus areas:** Sustainable work boundaries, dad role recovery, health baseline

Is there anything else about this month or your current state that I should factor in before we create your plan for the coming month?
