## Conversation

_Coach_: Let's do your weekly review. Here's your current context:

**Goals:**
- Daily capture via Slack is habitual and low-friction
- Weekly and monthly review workflows are working end-to-end
- Identity (values, roles, goals, mission) is integrated into prioritization
- I am no longer manually organizing or re-entering information
- A weekly review occurs most weeks without dread or excessive duration
- Reviews surface priorities, stuck items, and role imbalance
- Review output directly informs the coming weekâs plan
- Target duration: â¤ 60 minutes
- Tasks, worries, and ideas reliably get captured instead of rehearsed mentally
- Fewer open loops are held in working memory
- Decision fatigue is noticeably reduced
- Subjective reduction in overwhelm during planning and transitions
- Daily routines support regulation rather than depletion
- Health-related tracking (e.g. blood pressure, medication context) is captured reliably
- Rest and recovery are treated as non-negotiable inputs
- Writing or structured thinking occurs multiple times per week
- Output may be rough, unfinished, or private
- Momentum exists without self-punishment

**Open Loops:**
- [ ] Send bloodwork results to psychiatrist after Saturday appointment
- [ ] Complete CBT worksheet before next Thursday therapy session
- [ ] Prepare for DC trip Feb 9-12 (food containers for Audie, toys, blankets)
- [ ] Complete taxes by April 15
- [ ] Write performance reviews (due March 1)
- [ ] Weekly reminder: 1 hour of PCP research calls (time-boxed)
- [ ] Schedule dentist appointment for Saturday
- [ ] Groceries: eggs, bread, coffee
- [ ] Debug auth middleware issue in API refactor
