## Synthesis

Based on comprehensive research across 40 sources, **Playwright** emerges as the top choice for Node.js E2E testing in 2025, followed closely by **Cypress**. Playwright excels in cross-browser testing, performance, and modern web automation, while Cypress offers superior developer experience and debugging tools. For your bdd-test project, Playwright would provide the most comprehensive testing capabilities with excellent performance, though Cypress might be easier to get started with if you prioritize developer experience over cross-browser coverage.

The testing landscape shows a clear shift toward these modern frameworks, with traditional tools like Selenium losing ground due to slower performance and more complex setup. Both Playwright and Cypress offer built-in test runners, making them ideal for Node.js projects without additional dependencies.
