## Synthesis

For your bdd-test project, **Playwright** emerges as the top choice for Node.js E2E testing in 2025, followed closely by **Cypress**. Playwright excels in comprehensive cross-browser testing (including Safari/WebKit), superior performance (20-40% faster than competitors), and modern web automation capabilities. While Cypress offers the best developer experience with excellent debugging tools and time-travel debugging, it's limited to Chrome-based browsers with experimental Firefox support.

Given your focus on BDD testing, both frameworks integrate well with Cucumber.js for behavior-driven development. Playwright's zero-config setup, built-in test runner, and cross-browser reliability make it ideal for comprehensive testing scenarios, while Cypress might be easier to get started with if you prioritize developer experience over browser coverage. Traditional tools like Selenium are losing ground due to slower performance and complex setup requirements.
