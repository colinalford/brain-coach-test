<!--
Write your personal mission statement here.
This is your long-horizon orienting document — who you're becoming, what you're aiming at.
Revisit annually or when something fundamental shifts.

Questions to consider:
- What do I want my life to be about?
- What would I regret not pursuing?
- Who do I want to become?
-->

# Mission Statement

This mission statement does not describe an idealized version of me, nor the easiest possible life. It describes **a life that feels coherent, regulated, and meaningful**—one where my days are shaped intentionally and support both contribution and well‑being.

Rather than abstract purpose, this mission is expressed as a **picture of a good daily life**. This is the life I am orienting toward.

---

## The Shape of a Good Day

### Morning: Grounded and Unclaimed

I go to bed and wake up around the same time most days. My mornings belong to me before any other obligations.

When I wake, I move slowly and deliberately into the day. I begin with a brief meditation, ritual, or quiet check‑in. I look at my plans for the day—not to pressure myself, but to orient.

I walk my dog, spend some time outside, and move my body through light exercise or stretching. I eat on a consistent schedule that supports my health and energy.

The morning sets my nervous system, not my inbox.

---

### Workday: Engaged, Secure, and Effective

I go to work and I am effective.

My work is interesting, engaging, and rewarding. I feel competent and trusted. I get along with my colleagues and move through my responsibilities without constant anxiety or urgency.

I do not worry about money. My basic needs are met. I feel safe and secure in my work, and I trust that my effort is proportional to my stability.

Work takes energy, but it does not consume my identity.

---

### Evening: Closure and Choice

At the end of the workday, I have a closing ritual that marks the transition out of work mode.

I walk my dog again. I return to my body and my home.

Some evenings are quiet and restorative. Some are spent doing chores or tending to my space. Some include hobbies, events, or time with friends. I choose evenings based on capacity rather than obligation.

There is room for both rest and engagement.

---

### Weekends: Belonging, Rest, and Renewal

On weekends, I have hobbies and groups I am meaningfully engaged with. I participate in community in ways that feel safe, chosen, and sustaining.

I also make intentional time to be quiet—to rest, to reflect, to rejuvenate. Massage and self‑care are regular parts of my life, not emergency interventions.

I maintain a clean, tidy, and beautiful home. My yard and gardens are spaces I enjoy and tend, especially when the weather is kind.

My home feels safe. My community feels accepting. I feel like I belong.

---

## What This Mission Optimizes For

This mission prioritizes:

* nervous system stability over constant productivity
* consistency over intensity
* agency over pressure
* contribution without self‑erasure
* a life that can be lived sustainably

A good life, for me, is not defined by constant achievement. It is defined by **days that feel inhabitable** and a future that feels trustworthy.

---

## How This Is Used

This mission is a **long‑horizon orienting reference**.

It is used to:

* evaluate whether goals are pointing in the right direction
* resolve priority conflicts when short‑term salience is noisy
* notice when life drifts toward chronic stress or misalignment
* remind me what I am actually trying to protect and build

This document should change slowly, and only when my understanding of a good life genuinely evolves.

---

## Closing

The question this mission answers is simple:

> “If most of my days looked like this, would I feel that my life was working?”

This is the life I am orienting toward.


---

<!--
List your core values — what you refuse to sacrifice, what governs tradeoffs.
These determine what wins when priorities conflict.
Without explicit values, salience defaults to urgency, habit, or mood.

Format suggestion:
## Value Name
Brief description of what this means to you and how it shows up in decisions.
-->

# Core Values

This document captures the values that orient my life and decision‑making. These are not ideals I try to perform, nor rules I must obey. They are **patterns I choose to live toward**—directions rather than destinations.

Values here serve a specific function in my Second Brain system:

* They act as **long‑term salience anchors** when short‑term signals are noisy
* They help resolve conflicts between competing priorities
* They provide language for reflection without judgment
* They are revisitable and revisable as I change

These values are informed by lived experience, not aspiration alone.

---

## 1. Clarity Over Confusion

I value seeing clearly—myself, others, situations, and tradeoffs.

Clarity means:

* Naming what is actually happening, not what I wish were happening
* Distinguishing fear, obligation, and desire
* Letting go of distorted self‑perception and inherited narratives

I accept that clarity can be uncomfortable. I prefer accurate pain to false comfort.

When this value is honored, I am grounded and decisive.
When it is violated, I become stuck, self‑doubting, or avoidant.

---

## 2. Alignment With Intrinsic Motivation

I value acting from what is internally meaningful rather than externally imposed.

This includes:

* Differentiating what I *want* from what I think I *should* want
* Questioning goals rooted in shame, fear, or comparison
* Trusting that sustained action requires internal consent

I allow myself to revise goals when they no longer feel intrinsic.
Persistence without consent is not virtue; it is erosion.

---

## 3. Reduction of Unnecessary Suffering

I value minimizing suffering—my own and others’—where it is within my influence.

This does not mean avoiding discomfort or challenge.
It means:

* Not adding pain through self‑punishment, neglect, or denial
* Designing systems and environments that support regulation and safety
* Acting with care when power, vulnerability, or dependence is involved

I recognize suffering as subjective and contextual. I respond with curiosity, not absolutism.

---

## 4. Agency Within Constraint

I value my capacity to choose *how* I respond, even when options are limited.

This includes:

* Accepting biological, social, and structural constraints without resignation
* Looking for leverage rather than total control
* Taking responsibility only for what is actually mine to carry

Agency is not limitless freedom; it is **meaningful choice within reality**.

---

## 5. Honesty Without Cruelty

I value truth spoken with care.

This applies both inwardly and outwardly:

* Naming real problems without exaggeration or minimization
* Setting boundaries without aggression
* Refusing to weaponize insight against myself or others

I believe honesty that destroys safety is not wisdom.

---

## 6. Embodied Presence

I value being grounded in my body and nervous system, not living purely in abstraction.

This includes:

* Treating somatic signals as real data
* Respecting energy limits, sensory needs, and recovery cycles
* Allowing rest, pleasure, and regulation to be legitimate priorities

I reject the idea that worth is proven through exhaustion.

---

## 7. Meaningful Connection

I value relationships rooted in mutual recognition, respect, and consent.

This means:

* Being known as I am, not as I perform
* Allowing difference without domination or erasure
* Choosing depth over breadth when capacity is limited

Connection is not constant availability. It is **felt safety over time**.

---

## 8. Growth Through Integration, Not Erasure

I value growth that integrates past selves rather than disowning them.

This includes:

* Honoring what earlier versions of me were trying to protect
* Learning from mistakes without rewriting history
* Letting change accumulate rather than restart from zero

I do not need to be purified to be whole.

---

## 9. Stewardship of Attention and Energy

I value protecting my attention as a finite and precious resource.

This means:

* Saying no to misaligned demands
* Designing systems that reduce cognitive load
* Prioritizing what matters over what is loud

Attention is the medium through which my life happens.

---

## 10. Openness to Revision

I value the right to change my mind.

This includes:

* Revisiting values, goals, and identities without shame
* Treating consistency as a tool, not a moral requirement
* Allowing new information to update old commitments

Stability matters—but rigidity is not the same thing.

---

## Closing Note

These values are **orienting principles**, not a checklist.

When choices are difficult or salience is unclear, the question is not:

> “Am I living up to these perfectly?”

But rather:

> “Which direction do these point me toward right now?”

This document should be revisited periodically and revised as lived understanding deepens.

# Life Roles

This document defines the **roles I occupy in my life**. Roles are not identities I must perform perfectly, nor fixed labels I am trapped inside. They are **contexts of responsibility, care, and choice** that shape what matters and how I allocate attention and energy.

Roles function differently from values and goals:

* **Values** describe *how* I want to orient
* **Roles** describe *where* that orientation is expressed
* **Goals** describe *what* I am currently committing to within those roles

Roles can be stable or transient. Some persist across decades; others appear only for a season. All roles are revisitable.

---

## Core, Ongoing Roles

### 1. Self (Steward of Body, Mind, and Nervous System)

I am responsible for the care and stewardship of myself as an embodied being.

This role includes:

* Managing physical health, energy, and recovery
* Respecting sensory limits and nervous system needs
* Attending to mental health with seriousness and compassion
* Designing life structures that support regulation rather than depletion

This role is foundational. When it is neglected, all other roles degrade.

Some biographical information about me:
- Name: Colin Alford. I go by Coco with friends, Colin in my public/professional life.
- Birthday: 09/29/1987
- Hometown: Cookeville, TN 

---

### 2. Caregiver (for Dependents and Those Who Rely on Me)

I hold responsibility for beings who depend on me, including my dog and any others in my care.

This role includes:

* Providing safety, consistency, and attunement
* Meeting practical needs reliably
* Making decisions that balance my needs with theirs

Caregiving is not self-erasure. It is a role that must coexist with self-stewardship.

---

### 3. Partner / Relational Being

I am a relational being who seeks connection rooted in mutual recognition, consent, and respect.

This role includes:

* Showing up honestly in relationships
* Maintaining boundaries without withdrawal or aggression
* Allowing intimacy at a pace that supports safety

This role may be expressed differently across friendships, romantic relationships, and chosen family, but the core orientation remains the same.

---

### 4. Friend and Community Member

I participate in communities and friendships where shared values, care, and creativity are possible.

This role includes:

* Being present and responsive within capacity
* Contributing without overextending
* Allowing relationships to change or end without forcing continuity

Depth and trust matter more than scale.

---

## Professional and Creative Roles

### 5. Craftsperson / Builder

I engage in building—systems, ideas, tools, or structures—that reduce friction and increase clarity.

This role includes:

* Applying skill thoughtfully rather than reactively
* Caring about quality and maintainability
* Balancing creativity with responsibility

This role values making things that *work* and endure.

---

### 6. Knowledge Worker / Thinker

I think, analyze, synthesize, and make sense of complex systems.

This role includes:

* Deep engagement with ideas
* Translating complexity into usable insight
* Respecting limits around cognitive overload

Thinking is a contribution, not a performance.

---

### 7. Creator / Writer

I create to explore, clarify, and share meaning.

This role includes:

* Writing as a tool for sense-making
* Allowing unfinished or imperfect work
* Creating without immediate external validation

Creation is a process, not a product pipeline.

---

## Temporal and Contextual Roles

### 8. Planner and Steward of Time

I plan across multiple horizons: daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, yearly.

This role includes:

* Making realistic commitments
* Revisiting plans without guilt
* Allowing rest and change

Planning exists to serve life, not dominate it.

---

### 9. Learner

I remain open to learning, unlearning, and updating my understanding.

This role includes:

* Curiosity without pressure
* Letting new information revise old beliefs
* Allowing growth without self-rejection

---

### 10. Integrator (of Past, Present, and Future Selves)

I integrate experiences across time rather than disowning past versions of myself.

This role includes:

* Making sense of change without erasure
* Honoring what previous selves protected
* Carrying lessons forward without shame

Integration creates continuity and self-trust.

---

## Notes on Role Conflict and Revision

* Roles may compete for time and energy; conflict does not imply failure.
* Not all roles are active at all times.
* Some roles may be intentionally minimized or rested during certain seasons.
* Roles can be renamed, merged, or retired as life changes.

The purpose of naming roles is **clarity**, not obligation.

---

## Closing Reflection

When deciding what matters or what to do next, a useful question is:

> “Which role am I serving right now, and is that the role I want to prioritize in this moment?”

This document should be revisited periodically and revised as roles shift over time.


---

# Goals

This document captures my **specific, current goals**. These are concrete commitments I am choosing to make *now*, given my capacity, context, and priorities. They are not ideals, not identity claims, and not permanent obligations.

Goals translate **values and roles into action**:

* Values define *direction*
* Roles define *context*
* Goals define *what I am actively committing to in this period*

Goals are expected to change. Revising or releasing a goal is evidence of updated salience, not failure.

---

## How This Document Is Used

* Goals here should be **clear enough that progress is observable**.
* Each goal should be understandable without interpretation or motivational framing.
* Each goal implicitly answers:

  * Which role(s) does this serve?
  * Which value(s) does this express?

The Second Brain should treat this document as **authoritative but revisable state**.

---

**Serves roles:** Thinker, Creator / Writer, Craftsperson / Builder

---

## Longer-Horizon Directional Goals (1+ Years)

These are concrete *directions*, not rigid plans.

### 10. Live a life organized around clarity rather than fear

### 11. Build tools, writing, or frameworks that help others orient and reduce suffering

### 12. Maintain a life structure that supports agency, creativity, and connection

---

## Review and Release Rules

A goal should be reconsidered if:

* It is repeatedly deferred without external constraint
* It generates sustained push with no clear importance
* The role or value it served has changed
* New information alters feasibility or desirability

Releasing a goal intentionally is a valid and successful outcome.

---

## The Second Brain’s Responsibilities

The Second Brain should:

* Track which goals receive action vs. stagnation
* Cross-reference goals with values and roles during prioritization
* Surface gaps gently during reviews
* Treat avoidance and delay as **signal**, not failure
* Ask whether goals still have internal consent

The system may suggest adjustments or reflect patterns, but **final authority always remains with me**.

---

## Closing Note

Goals exist to focus effort, not to justify worth.

The guiding question is:

> “Given who I am and the life I’m living, are these the right commitments right now?”

This document should be revised whenever clarity changes.
