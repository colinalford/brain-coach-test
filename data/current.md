## Today's Stream

## Captures

- 12:33 | [research] I need you to look up integrative health clinics and doctors offices in Asheville. I want: 1. Name 2. Phone number 3. Address 4. Membership fees (AI summary: how much does it cost and what are options) 5. What can you find about insurance (do they accept? Do they use it for some procedures? Do they give a super bill?) 6. Are they accepting new patients?
- 21:44 | Frustrated with integrative clinic call - they won't deal with insurance, so Zepbound would be fully out of pocket (even though I qualify for coverage), sleep apnea testing would be out of pocket too. Need a PCP for diagnosis codes and referrals. Feel stuck. Labs scheduled for tomorrow but might need to reschedule due to snowstorm. Very tired.

# Mission Statement

This mission statement does not describe an idealized version of me, nor the easiest possible life. It describes **a life that feels coherent, regulated, and meaningful**ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂone where my days are shaped intentionally and support both contribution and wellÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂbeing.

Rather than abstract purpose, this mission is expressed as a **picture of a good daily life**. This is the life I am orienting toward.

## The Shape of a Good Day

### Morning: Grounded and Unclaimed

I go to bed and wake up around the same time most days. My mornings belong to me before any other obligations.

When I wake, I move slowly and deliberately into the day. I begin with a brief meditation, ritual, or quiet checkÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂin. I look at my plans for the dayÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂnot to pressure myself, but to orient.

I walk my dog, spend some time outside, and move my body through light exercise or stretching. I eat on a consistent schedule that supports my health and energy.

The morning sets my nervous system, not my inbox.

---

### Workday: Engaged, Secure, and Effective

I go to work and I am effective.

My work is interesting, engaging, and rewarding. I feel competent and trusted. I get along with my colleagues and move through my responsibilities without constant anxiety or urgency.

I do not worry about money. My basic needs are met. I feel safe and secure in my work, and I trust that my effort is proportional to my stability.

Work takes energy, but it does not consume my identity.

---

### Evening: Closure and Choice

At the end of the workday, I have a closing ritual that marks the transition out of work mode.

I walk my dog again. I return to my body and my home.

Some evenings are quiet and restorative. Some are spent doing chores or tending to my space. Some include hobbi
